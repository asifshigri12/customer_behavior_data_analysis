# Customer Behavior Analysis Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python, SQL, Power BI, and Gamma API. The goal is to transform raw customer data into actionable insights through exploratory analysis, database querying, visualization, and reporting.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Customer behavior dataset  
- **Size:** 3,900 rows × 18 columns  
- **Description:** Includes customer demographics, purchase behavior, subscription status, shipping preferences, and spending information.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **SQL:** PostgreSQL / MySQL  
- **Power BI:** Data modeling, DAX, dashboards  
- **Gamma API:** For automated data access  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Git & GitHub**

## Steps
1. **Data Loading:** Imported raw data into Python using Pandas.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzed distributions, trends, and outliers; handled missing values.  
3. **Data Cleaning:** Replaced missing/null values, standardized columns, created derived columns.  
4. **SQL Analysis:** Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL/MySQL and executed queries for aggregations, joins, and business metrics.  
5. **Dashboard Development:** Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with KPIs, trends, and filters.  
6. **Reporting & API Integration:** Created structured analytical reports and developed Gamma API for processed data access.

## Dashboard
- Key performance indicators (Total Customers, Average Purchase Amount, Average Rating)  
- Category-wise purchase and revenue analysis  
- Subscription and age-group segmentation  
- Interactive filters for deeper exploration

## Results & Insights
- Clothing is the top revenue-generating category  
- Subscribed customers spend more and are repeat buyers  
- Young Adults are the most valuable customer segment  
- Express shipping correlates with higher purchase values  
- Discounts are effective but should be optimized for specific products

## How to Run
1. Run Jupyter notebooks for EDA and data cleaning.  
2. Execute SQL scripts on your PostgreSQL/MySQL server.  
3. Open the Power BI file to explore the dashboard.  
4. Start the Gamma API for automated access (if applicable).
